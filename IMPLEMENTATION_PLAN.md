Below is a proposed file structure along with details on how each component fits into the project. This plan assumes you’ll use the [Thor](https://github.com/erikhuda/thor) gem for argument parsing and [ruby-llm](https://github.com/your_org/ruby-llm) for interacting with LLM APIs.

### Detailed Component Breakdown

#### 1. **Gemfile**

Your `Gemfile` declares dependencies for the project. For example:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem 'thor'
gem 'ruby-llm'
# Optionally, add gems for testing:
gem 'rspec', '~> 3.10'
```

This ensures that when users install your tool (or when it’s packaged in Homebrew), the correct gems are available.

---

#### 2. **Executable: bin/how**

This file serves as the command-line entry point. It should be executable and load your CLI class.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require_relative "../lib/how"

How::CLI.start(ARGV)
```

Make sure to set executable permissions on this file (`chmod +x bin/how`).

---

#### 3. **Main File: lib/how.rb**

This file is used to require all your internal modules. It provides a single point of entry for the library.

```ruby
require "thor"
require_relative "how/cli"
require_relative "how/context_gatherer"
require_relative "how/llm_client"
require_relative "how/executor"
require_relative "how/config"
```

---

#### 4. **CLI Module: lib/how/cli.rb**

This file contains the Thor class that defines the CLI commands and argument parsing. For instance:

```ruby
module How
  class CLI < Thor
    desc "explain TOOL TASK_DESCRIPTION", "Explain how to use TOOL to accomplish TASK_DESCRIPTION"
    def explain(tool, *task_description)
      task = task_description.join(" ")
      
      # 1. Gather context from the tool using various help commands.
      context = How::ContextGatherer.get_info(tool)
      
      # 2. Build prompt for the LLM.
      prompt = "Using the following context:\n#{context}\nExplain how to #{task}"
      
      # 3. Get LLM response using ruby-llm.
      response = How::LLMClient.get_response(prompt)
      
      # 4. Display response and ask for confirmation.
      puts "Proposed Operation:\n#{response[:command]}"
      puts "Explanation:\n#{response[:explanation]}"
      print "Execute this command? (y/n): "
      answer = $stdin.gets.chomp.downcase
      
      if answer == 'y'
        How::Executor.execute(response[:command])
      else
        puts "Aborted."
      end
    rescue => e
      puts "Error: #{e.message}"
    end
  end
end
```

This design uses a single Thor command (`explain`) that takes a tool and a task description, then orchestrates the subsequent steps.

---

#### 5. **Context Gathering Module: lib/how/context_gatherer.rb**

This module gathers information from the target CLI tool by executing various help commands:

```ruby
module How
  module ContextGatherer
    def self.get_info(tool)
      outputs = []
      # Try standard help flag:
      outputs << run_command("#{tool} --help")
      # Try shorthand flags:
      outputs << run_command("#{tool} -h")
      outputs << run_command("#{tool} -?")
      # Try the man page:
      outputs << run_command("man #{tool}")
      # Filter out any empty outputs and combine results.
      outputs.compact.join("\n---\n")
    end

    def self.run_command(command)
      result = `#{command} 2>&1`
      result unless result.empty?
    rescue => e
      "Error executing #{command}: #{e.message}"
    end
  end
end
```

This module tries multiple common methods (including shorthand help flags) to extract useful documentation from the CLI tool.

---

#### 6. **LLM Client Module: lib/how/llm_client.rb**

This module interacts with the LLM API using the `ruby-llm` gem. It should also handle reading the API token from an environment variable or configuration file:

```ruby
require 'ruby-llm'

module How
  module LLMClient
    def self.get_response(prompt)
      token = How::Config.api_token
      raise "API token not configured" unless token

      client = RubyLLM::Client.new(api_token: token)
      result = client.complete(prompt: prompt)
      
      # Here we assume the result includes keys :command and :explanation.
      {
        command: result[:command] || "No command provided",
        explanation: result[:explanation] || "No explanation provided"
      }
    rescue => e
      raise "LLM request failed: #{e.message}"
    end
  end
end
```

Adjust the response parsing as needed based on the actual format provided by `ruby-llm`.

---

#### 7. **Executor Module: lib/how/executor.rb**

This module safely executes the proposed command after user confirmation:

```ruby
module How
  module Executor
    def self.execute(command)
      puts "Executing: #{command}"
      system(command)
    rescue => e
      puts "Execution failed: #{e.message}"
    end
  end
end
```

Include any additional logging or safety checks (like a dry-run option) if needed.

---

#### 8. **Configuration Module: lib/how/config.rb**

This module manages reading and writing configuration, such as the API token. It checks for an environment variable first, then looks into a configuration file (e.g., `~/.how/config.yml`):

```ruby
require 'yaml'

module How
  module Config
    CONFIG_PATH = File.join(Dir.home, ".how", "config.yml")

    def self.api_token
      ENV['LLM_API_TOKEN'] || read_config["llm_api_token"]
    end

    def self.read_config
      if File.exist?(CONFIG_PATH)
        YAML.load_file(CONFIG_PATH)
      else
        {}
      end
    rescue => e
      puts "Error reading config: #{e.message}"
      {}
    end
  end
end
```

You can later expand this module to support writing configurations, default values, etc.

---

#### 9. **Tests: spec/**

Place tests for each module in the `spec/` directory. For example, `spec/cli_spec.rb` would contain tests for your CLI commands, while `spec/context_gatherer_spec.rb` would validate that the correct help outputs are being captured.

---

### Summary

- **Thor (in `lib/how/cli.rb`)** handles argument parsing and orchestrates the flow.
- **ContextGatherer (in `lib/how/context_gatherer.rb`)** runs various commands (`--help`, `-h`, `-?`, `man`) to retrieve tool documentation.
- **LLMClient (in `lib/how/llm_client.rb`)** interfaces with the LLM using `ruby-llm` and uses configuration data from **Config (in `lib/how/config.rb`)**.
- **Executor (in `lib/how/executor.rb`)** runs the proposed command upon user approval.
- The **executable (`bin/how`)** ties everything together, starting the CLI process.

This structure keeps your code modular and testable while leveraging popular Ruby gems and aligning well with Homebrew’s ecosystem. Does this level of detail meet your needs, or would you like to explore any part further?
